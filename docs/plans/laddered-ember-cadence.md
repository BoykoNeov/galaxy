# Individual (per-particle rung) timesteps on the SPH path

Scoping doc, written 2026-07-08. The deferred follow-up named in
`courant-quickening-cadence.md` (global block-adaptive, A1–A5 DONE) and in
`long-burning-beacon.md` Chain A step 5 ("INDIVIDUAL … block timesteps remain
the deferred follow-up"). Global adaptive gives ONE `dt` shared by all
particles, recomputed at block boundaries. This lifts that to a **per-particle**
timestep: each gas particle sits on its own power-of-two rung and is
re-integrated only when its rung is due, so the diffuse majority of the box
steps far less often than the shocked knot that pins the global bound.

**This is a scoping doc.** The design below is advisor-vetted (2026-07-08). The
first milestone is a **measurement that is a go/no-go** — see I0. Do not start
the integrator rewrite until the distribution number is in hand.

## ⚠ CRITICAL: the 34× is the WRONG number — measure the right one first

The A5 run's headline "CFL-bound dynamic range 34.2×" (min 3.42e-3, max
1.17e-1) is the **temporal** range: the value of the *global* (min-over-
particles) CFL bound at *different times* in the run. **Global block-adaptive
already captures every bit of that** — `sim::run_adaptive` sets `dt` from exactly
this global min at each block boundary (`plan_block`, `sim/src/lib.rs:242`). It
is banked. Individual timesteps do **not** re-bank it.

What individual timesteps buy is a **different** quantity: the **spatial spread
of `h_i / v_sig,i` across particles at a single instant** — at the moment the
global bound is pinned to its tightest knot, how many particles *actually* need
that tiny step versus could take 8–30× more. That distribution is exactly the
per-particle vector `solvers/src/sph/cfl.rs` computes and then `min`s away
(lines 103, 139). **It has never been measured.** It — not the 34× — governs
the speedup:

```text
expected wall-clock speedup ≈ N / (Σ_r active_count(r) · 2^(r_max − r))
                            ≈ N / (effective count of short-rung particles)
```

- Small dense knot sets the bound, rest of the box diffuse → **large win**.
- Shocked region is a big fraction of particles at pericenter → **<2×**, and
  the integrator rewrite is not worth it.

**I0 (below) is a cheap xtask that produces this number. Write it into this doc
before committing to the rewrite.** This is the tightest constraint; verify it
first.

## I0 RESULT (measured 2026-07-08; seed sweep + Amdahl split 2026-07-09) — go/no-go pivots to a SCOPE call, not FULL regen

> **TL;DR (2026-07-09, revised):** the hydro rung ceiling (I0) is tail-fragile
> (drop-finest median ~2.9×), but the binding question is the Amdahl fraction — which
> path rungs actually accelerate. There are **TWO reducibility levers**, not one:
> **(a) per-active-particle dt recompute** (the CFL solve, 17 % of cost) comes *free*
> with hydro-only rungs — you cannot assign gas rungs without per-particle `dt`, and it
> reduces to the active subset and fuses with the hydro density solve; **(b) the gravity
> tree WALK** (build:walk = 0.68 ⇒ walk is the majority) reduces only if scope EXPANDS
> to subcycle gravity on a stale tree. So: **hydro-only rungs ≈ 1.68× (drop-finest) /
> ~2.0× (median) — clears the user's 30 % bar on lever (a) alone**; **+ gravity
> subcycling ≈ 2.24× / 3.06×**. The decision is a **scope call** (how far to push, not
> whether it pays), NOT a FULL regen. See the "AMDAHL SPLIT" subsection below.
>
> **Scope call RESOLVED (2026-07-09):** build BOTH levers as a **layered opt-in
> toggle** `[sim.individual].mode = fixed-dt | hydro-only | hydro+gravity`, each
> mode droppable to the one below (so gravity subcycling can be turned off later
> without losing the hydro-only win). ⚠ The ~2.24× (`hydro+gravity`) carries an
> **unmeasured** term — I0 measured *gas CFL* rungs; lever (b)'s walk factor is
> the *star gravitational-rung* spread, gated by a new precondition **I0b**
> (gravitational `rung-spread`) before any gravity-subcycling code. `hydro-only`
> (~1.68×) stands on I0's already-measured spread and clears the bar on its own.

The xtask exists: `galaxy-xtask rung-spread <snapshots_dir | .snap>` (isothermal
arm of `cfl.rs` copied verbatim, `min` removed; the copy's `min` is asserted
**bit-for-bit equal** to the shipped `max_stable_dt` on every reported snapshot —
the I1 invariant used as a runtime self-check, so the number rides a verified code
path without touching the shipped bound). It scans a run for the pericenter (the
tightest global bound), histograms the per-particle rungs there and at the early
diffuse snapshot, and reports the ideal-ceiling speedup `N_gas·2^r_max / Σ_i 2^r_i`
plus a tail-sensitivity sweep. Corrections folded in vs the sketch above:
- **`N` is GAS-ONLY.** Collisionless rows have `dt = +∞` (coarsest rung); padding
  `N` with them inflates the ratio ~3.4× and could flip the verdict. Speedup is of
  the **SPH/hydro stepping**, not whole-sim (gravity-over-all is untouched by rungs).
- **The plan's printed denominator `Σ_r n_r·2^(r_max−r)` has the exponent inverted**
  (gives speedup <1). Correct: `speedup = N_gas·2^r_max / Σ_i 2^r_i ≡ N_gas / Σ_i
  2^(r_i−r_max)`, matching the plan's own gloss "≈ N / effective short-rung count".
  `⌈log2⌉` binning under-states the win (safe side). The ceiling **excludes** I7
  overhead (that's I6's net number).
- Speedup is **invariant to `dt_base`** (the diffuse end); it is governed entirely
  by the fine tail `dt_min`.

**Only QUICK snapshots are retained** (`m7f_gasdemo`, and the QUICK `a5_movie`
render — both seed `0x00C0FFEE`, 2500 gas). The A5 **full-res** run's snapshots went
to a test tempdir and were **not** retained; only its log survives. So the number
below is QUICK — NOT the plan's decision regime.

QUICK pericenter (t=10, snapshot 20/60): **3.90× ideal ceiling**, N_gas=2500,
spatial dynamic range **537×** (vs the temporal 34× that global adaptive already
banks). **VERDICT: INCONCLUSIVE.** The 3.90× straddles the ≥3× GO line and is
**tail-fragile**: the finest rung r=10 is only **6 particles (0.2%)**; resolving one
rung coarser (cap r=9) drops the ceiling to **1.96× (<2× STOP)**. The 6 are
*physical* (v_sig ≈ 3.9, a real shock; h ≈ 0.035 vs median 0.089 — not an
artifact-`h` outlier), so the win is genuine per the definition — but it is a
small-number statistic at QUICK resolution.

**QUICK cannot settle the go/no-go, and the QUICK→FULL direction is two-sided:**
soft QUICK gas (large `h`) *narrows* the spread ⇒ FULL ≥ QUICK; but FULL has 2.8×
more gas and a better-resolved shock could put a *larger fraction* on the fine rungs
⇒ FULL < QUICK (the plan's own "<2×" stop case). These cancel — no extrapolation.

### SEED SWEEP (2026-07-09) — the tail-fragility is STRUCTURAL, not seed-noise

Four fresh QUICK realizations (seeds `0x1234`, `0xDEADBEEF`, `0xCAFEBABE`,
`0x5EED`; distinct t=0 gas fingerprints ⇒ genuinely different ICs), each stepped
on the CPU adaptive path and passed through `rung-spread`. Each seed's
auto-selected tightest-bound snapshot (full-tail ideal ceiling → **drop-finest**
= cap one rung above the finest, the "is the tail load-bearing" test):

| seed | tightest | full | drop-finest | finest rung | count @ finest | haircut |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00C0FFEE` (shipped) | t=10 | 3.90× | **1.96×** | r=10 | 6 (0.2%) | −50% |
| `0x00C0FFEE` t=30 (same run) | t=30 | 3.44× | **1.84×** | r=12 | 98 (3.9%) | −46% |
| `0x1234` | t=30 | 2.91× | **1.88×** | r=13 | 383 (15.3%) | −35% |
| `0xDEADBEEF` | t=29.5 | 5.10× | 2.95× | r=16 | 132 (5.3%) | −42% |
| `0xCAFEBABE` | t=30 | 7.37× | 4.03× | r=15 | 58 (2.3%) | −45% |
| `0x5EED` | t=30 | 4.62× | 2.90× | r=16 | 219 (8.8%) | −37% |

**Three findings, in priority order:**

1. **The finest-rung haircut is 35–50% in EVERY realization.** ~40% of the ideal
   ceiling rides on the single finest rung *everywhere* — the sweep **validates**
   the plan's tail-fragility worry rather than dispelling it. It is a **structural**
   feature of the CFL distribution at a shocked pericenter, not a shipped-seed
   artifact.
2. **Tail *population* is NOT the robustness signal — magnitude is.** `0x1234` has
   the *most*-populated finest rung of any seed (383 particles, 15.3%) yet is the
   *most* fragile fresh seed (drop-finest **1.88×**, below 2×): it fails by fine-end
   **bunching** (rungs 11–13 hold 60.7% of gas ⇒ distribution not spread ⇒ low
   speedup), a different mechanism from the shipped seed's lonely 6-particle spike
   but the same bottom line. So "populated tail ⇒ robust" is **wrong**; the honest
   discriminator is the base-speedup magnitude, which is **realization-dependent**
   (full-tail 2.9–7.4×, median ~4.9×; drop-finest 1.9–4.0×, **median ~2.9×**).
3. **The shipped seed IS genuinely gentle** (confound-checked): its *own* t=30
   snapshot has min dt 1.5e-2 vs the fresh seeds' ~1e-3 (10× looser), and the tool
   picked its t=10 (min dt 3.4e-3) as tighter still — it was selected CFL-clean, so
   it is the mildest realization. But per finding (1) that gentleness does not make
   the *fragility* seed-specific.

**Verdict unchanged: INCONCLUSIVE — the sweep does NOT flip it to GO** (and does
not kill it). "Robustly ≥3×" is **not met at QUICK**: drop-finest median ~2.9× sits
below the 3× bar, and 3 of 6 measurements (incl. one fresh seed) fall below 2×. The
screen is **weakly encouraging on raw magnitude** (full-tail 2.9–7.4×) but
**confirms tail-fragility is structural**. Whether that universal ~40% tail actually
*pays* is exactly the I7 grid-rebuild/prediction-overhead question — and QUICK
cannot answer it.

**Next (pending user, resource call): FULL-res regen** (~48 min adaptive sim, or
truncate `n_steps` to ~t=12 past pericenter) — the plan's primary regime, the real
number. The tool takes any snapshot dir, so FULL is zero rework. The sweep sharpens
what FULL must report: **drop-finest is a co-headline, not a footnote**, paired with
a real **I7 overhead** number (grid-rebuild + neighbour-prediction cost vs the
gathered force) — because the ~40% tail's payoff hinges on that overhead. **Do NOT
start I1 until FULL clears ≥3× robustly (drop-finest, not just full-tail).**

### AMDAHL SPLIT (2026-07-09) — the rung ceiling is NOT the binding number; the gravity-cadence scope is

The seed sweep left "FULL regen" as the next step, but the user pushed back: a FULL
run at *today's* N is one more point on the weak (scaling) axis, and "even 30 % off a
2-day production bake is significant." That reframed the go/no-go, and the advisor
named the number both were circling: **the rung ceiling only accelerates the gas
(hydro) stepping — the whole-sim win is capped by the Amdahl fraction of that path,**
which comes from timing an *existing* snapshot (no regen). Measured on the shipped
pericenter (`a5_movie/snapshot_00000020`, N=7500 = 2500 gas + 5000 stars), per force
eval:

Measured at **one gentle snapshot** (the shipped seed's pericenter, already shown to be
the mildest realization in the seed sweep) — timings are structural (set by N, gas
fraction, tree depth) so more transferable than the rung spread, but the build:walk
ratio specifically is clustering-sensitive (walk rises at a tighter pericenter), so read
the split with a ± and re-measure if the scope call goes forward.

| term | cost/block | reducible under rungs? |
|---|---|---|
| gravity build (Barnes-Hut, O(N)) | 120 ms | **no** — fixed floor, rebuilt at most once/block |
| gravity walk (O(active·log N)) | 176 ms | **only via lever (b)** — stale-tree subcycle |
| density + hydro (gas subset) | 347 ms | **yes** — active-subset, the core rung win |
| CFL / per-particle `dt` | 134 ms | **yes via lever (a)** — see below |
| **total** | **777 ms** | |

(Per force eval: gravity 18.5 ms = build 7.5 : walk 11.0 = **0.68**; density+hydro
21.7 ms; ×16 steps/block. CFL is once/block.)

**The key correction (advisor, 2026-07-09): CFL is a reducibility LEVER, not a fixed
cost — and it comes FREE with hydro-only rungs.** You cannot put gas on individual rungs
without a per-particle `dt_i = c·h_i/v_sig,i`; a particle's rung IS that number. Under
rungs you recompute `dt_i` only when a particle *wakes* (active subset), and the density
+ v_sig it needs is the *same* solve the hydro force already does at that tick — so the
134 ms/block is the **non-rung** "compute all gas dt once per block" baseline, and under
rungs it reduces to the active subset and fuses with the force eval. Charging it as
"fixed" (my first pass) understated the hydro-only win. So there are **two levers:**

- **Lever (a) — per-active-particle dt recompute (CFL).** Free with hydro-only rungs;
  turns the 134 ms/block from fixed into active-subset-reducible.
- **Lever (b) — gravity WALK on a stale tree.** The O(N) build (120 ms/block) can't be
  cut, but the walk (176 ms/block, the majority since build:walk = 0.68) reduces to the
  active subset IF the tree is reused stale across the base block (2^r_max ≫ 1 fine
  ticks) + inactive neighbours are predicted — the I7 "safe over-gather on a stale
  spatial structure" argument applied to gravity. Rebuild-every-tick would be
  build × 2^r_max (catastrophic), so stale reuse is mandatory, and build:walk = 0.68 +
  a ≫1-tick block make it strongly favoured. **But this is a SCOPE EXPANSION** (gravity
  prediction + a gravitational-dt floor for the now-subcycled stars), beyond the plan's
  current "hydro-only rungs, gravity untouched."

**Whole-sim speedup (Amdahl, using the drop-finest rung 2.9× as the conservative/robust
factor, median 2.9× / ideal ∞ in parentheses):**

| scope | f_accel | drop-finest 2.9× | median-tail 4.9× | ideal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| both fixed (my first-pass strawman) | 0.45 | 1.41× | 1.55× | 1.81× |
| **hydro-only rungs — lever (a) only** | **0.62** | **1.68×** | **1.97×** | 2.62× |
| **+ gravity subcycling — levers (a)+(b)** | **0.85** | **2.24×** | **3.06×** | 6.44× |

**So the conclusion flips vs my first pass: hydro-only rungs clear the user's 30 % bar
on lever (a) alone (~1.68× drop-finest, ~2.0× median) — they do NOT "lean STOP."** The
"hydro accelerates only ~54 %" framing was wrong: it silently parked the CFL solve in
the fixed bucket when it is inherently part of the rung machinery. **I3's "kick only the
active subset each fine tick"** already implies both the hydro reduction and (with stale
reuse) the gravity-walk reduction — the plan's own integrator is model-(a)+(b)-shaped.

**The go/no-go is therefore a SCOPE call — how FAR to push, not whether it pays:**
- **Hydro-only rungs (as scoped):** ~1.68× drop-finest / ~2.0× median before I7
  overhead. Clears 30 %. Simpler; still carries the variable-dt integration risk (breaks
  symplectic leapfrog — a permanent maintenance surface on an opt-in feature), so the
  honest bar is net-of-I7-overhead AND risk-discounted, but the headroom above 1.3× is
  now real, not marginal.
- **+ gravity subcycling (scope expansion):** ~2.24× / ~3.06×, but a bigger design
  (gravity prediction + stale-tree gather + a gravitational-dt floor for subcycled
  stars).

**Answering the user's two questions directly:** (1) *"how valid at 10–100× more?"* —
the accelerable fraction erodes at scale, but only **logarithmically**, not off a cliff:
at fixed gas fraction gravity ~ N log N and hydro ~ N_gas ~ fN, so gravity/hydro ~ log N
— a gentle slope. "More stars" inflates the O(N) build floor (over ALL N incl. stars),
which is the term lever (b) can't cut, so scale specifically favours *doing* the gravity
subcycling (lever b) rather than hydro-only — but hydro-only's lever (a) win survives the
log-N dilution comfortably at any realistic N. (2) *"30 % of a 2-day bake matters"* —
agreed, the bar is ~1.3×, and hydro-only rungs (~1.68×) clear it before the bigger
gravity design is even considered.

**FULL regen is now LOW value** for this decision: a same-N run resolves neither the
build:walk-at-scale trend nor the gravity-scope call, and the seed sweep already showed
the hydro ceiling is structurally tail-fragile. The next decision is a **scope call by
the user**, not a compute run. (Throwaway harness `xtask/examples/amdahl_split.rs`
measured this via `FlatTree::build` for the build floor + `GravitySph::accel_and_dudt`
minus `BarnesHut::accelerations` for the hydro/gravity split; deleted after — the
numbers are the deliverable, reconstructable, and if the plan proceeds it should be
promoted to a TDD'd `galaxy-xtask amdahl-split` subcommand beside `rung-spread`.)

---

## What it buys — and what it does NOT

- **Buys (primary, `hydro-only` mode): wall-clock speedup** from the per-instant
  spatial spread of the *gas CFL* bound — the diffuse majority steps on coarse
  rungs while only the shocked minority steps fine. Magnitude set by I0
  (~1.68× drop-finest whole-sim), not assumed. This lever (a) already clears the
  user's 30% bar without touching gravity.
- **Buys (`hydro+gravity` mode): a further speedup from subcycling gravity** on a
  stale tree — the O(N·logN) tree WALK reduces to the active subset (the O(N)
  *build* cannot; build:walk ≈ 0.68). Targets ~2.24× whole-sim, but the walk's
  effective factor rests on the *star gravitational-rung* spread, which is
  **unmeasured** (I0 measured gas CFL rungs only) — flagged, gated by I0b, and
  could run either way (see AMDAHL SPLIT + I-grav).
- **Buys (secondary): shock fidelity via the timestep limiter** — a slow-rung
  particle hit by a fast shock is forced awake (I5). This is a *correctness*
  gain over global adaptive's uniform coarse step in quiescent phases, not just
  speed.
- **Does NOT buy:** anything on the gas-free (collisionless) path, exact energy
  conservation, or time-reversibility (variable per-particle dt forfeits both,
  same as global adaptive — D2 of the parent plan carries over and worsens).
- **Does NOT buy** a GPU speedup — GPU is deferred (I-GPU); the resident path's
  single-`dt` batching IS its throughput win and per-particle rungs defeat it.

---

## Scope (v1)

- **CPU only.** SPH (gas) path. Both EOS arms (isothermal + adiabatic/thermal),
  because the thermal path (`LeapfrogKdkThermal` + `u`) is now the physics of
  interest post-E and its `du/dt` kick must be rung-aware too.
- **Third path, byte-untouched neighbours.** A new active-set integrator AND a
  new driver (`sim::run_individual`), added *beside* `run` (fixed-dt) and
  `run_adaptive` (global) — exactly how `run_adaptive` was added beside `run`.
  The fixed-dt and global-adaptive byte-paths are **literally untouched**, so
  their gates (fixed-dt reversibility/energy oscillation; global-adaptive
  convergence + D2b) stay intact and green.
- **A LAYERED, opt-in toggle — three modes, each droppable to the one below.**
  The Amdahl split (below) found two independent reducibility levers, so the
  feature is a *sub-toggle*, not all-or-nothing — mirroring how `[sim.adaptive]`
  / `gasrich` opt in to global adaptive. `[sim.individual].mode`:
  - **`fixed-dt`** (default / OFF) — no rungs; the fixed-dt or global-adaptive
    path runs unchanged.
  - **`hydro-only`** — gas CFL rungs (lever **a**). Delivers ~1.68× drop-finest
    on lever (a) alone (clears the user's 30% bar); collisionless stars stay on
    the coarsest rung (hydro `dt = +∞`), gravity is walked over all-N once per
    base block as today. Carries the variable-dt integration risk (breaks
    symplectic leapfrog).
  - **`hydro+gravity`** — additionally subcycles gravity on a stale tree (lever
    **b**), giving currently-`dt=+∞` stars finite *gravitational* rungs. Targets
    ~2.24× (with an **unmeasured** walk-factor caveat — see I-grav / I0b).
  - **Dropping gravity subcycling later = flip `hydro+gravity` → `hydro-only`**,
    which falls back to 1.68×, *not* to fixed-dt. This is exactly the user's
    "toggleable if we decide later we don't want it": the fallback is graceful,
    one rung of the ladder, not the whole feature.
- **Collisionless-only (gas-free) runs** stay on fixed-dt `run` in *every* mode —
  the gravitational per-particle criterion added by `hydro+gravity` exists to
  subcycle STARS *within a gas run* (so the gravity walk reduces to an active
  subset), not to turn a pure-N-body run into an individual-timestep run.
- GPU individual timesteps: **deferred**, rationale recorded (I-GPU).

## Key decisions (with rationale)

### I0 — MEASURE the per-instant rung distribution FIRST (go/no-go)
A tiny xtask: load a `gasrich` snapshot — **near pericenter, where the global
bound is tightest and individual timesteps help most** (and, for contrast, an
early diffuse snapshot) — run the existing per-particle CFL body with the `min`
**removed**, and histogram `dt_i = c_cfl · h_i / v_sig,i`. Reuses `cfl.rs`
almost verbatim (the per-`i` loop already exists; drop the `min_dt.min(...)`
fold and collect the vector). Report: the rung histogram, the fraction on the
tightest rung, and the projected speedup `N / Σ_r n_r · 2^(r_max−r)`.
**Decision rule (SUPERSEDED — see AMDAHL SPLIT):** the go/no-go is no longer
"≥3× at pericenter"; the Amdahl split reframed it as a *scope call* — how far up
the ladder to build. `hydro-only` (lever a) already clears the user's 30% bar at
~1.68×; `hydro+gravity` (lever b) targets ~2.24×. Hours, not days.

### I0b — MEASURE the star GRAVITATIONAL-rung spread (precondition for `hydro+gravity` ONLY)
I0/rung-spread measured **gas CFL rungs only** (`h_i / v_sig,i`). Lever (b)'s
~2.24× — the gravity-walk reduction — rests on the **star gravitational-rung**
distribution, a *different criterion* (`dt ~ η·√(ε / |a_i|)`, not `c·h/v_sig`)
over a *larger, different population* (5000 stars vs 2500 gas in the measured
snapshot). Borrowing gas's 2.9× drop-finest for the walk is an **unmeasured
extrapolation**, and it is genuinely two-sided: stars bunching fine near the
merger core weaken the factor; a broad spread with many coarse slow stars
strengthens it. (Direction note: the baseline `run_adaptive` already steps *all*
stars at the global min dt — wasteful for slow stars — so subcycling gravity
helps stars too; treating the walk as accelerable is defensible, just
un-quantified.) **I0b = a gravitational analogue of `rung-spread`**: histogram
`dt_i = η·√(ε/|a_i|)` over stars+gas at pericenter, drop-finest factor, projected
walk speedup. Run it **before any `hydro+gravity` (I-grav) code** — it firms up
the one number the ON path's payoff hangs on. It is NOT a precondition for
`hydro-only`, which stands on I0's already-measured gas spread. Measure it from
an existing snapshot; no regen. This is a distinct tool from `rung-spread`
(different criterion), so it is deliberately deferred to the point it pays,
per the advisor.

**I0b RESULT (2026-07-09) — MARGINAL, reopens the scope call (does NOT close it).**
`grav-rung-spread` (xtask) landed and ran on the retained gasrich QUICK run
(`m7f_gasdemo`, seed 0x00C0FFEE, ε=0.05, θ=0.5). At the star gravitational
pericenter (t=28, `snapshot_00005600`):

- **star drop-finest walk factor = 1.42×** (full-tail 2.84×). 56% of stars bunch
  on a single rung — exactly the `dt ∝ |a|^(−½)` compression the criterion
  predicts (spread NARROWER than the gas CFL spread, as flagged two-sidedly above:
  this run landed on the *bunch-fine* side).
- **Amdahl reprojection** (2026-07-09 block split: build 120 / walk 176 /
  hydro 347 / cfl 134 ms, total 777):
  - hydro-only (lever a, ships regardless): **1.68×**
  - hydro+gravity, MEASURED w_grav=1.42×: **1.90×** — only **+13%** over hydro-only.
  - hydro+gravity, full-tail w_grav=2.84×: **2.23×** — recovers the pre-registered
    **2.24×**, confirming that number was the *ideal ceiling* (borrowed 2.9×); the
    finest-rung penalty pulls the realistic drop-finest figure down to 1.90×.
- **Robustness:** a θ=0 exact (direct-sum) rerun gives an identical rung
  distribution (drop-finest 1.42×, cross-check 1.3e-14) ⇒ the bunching is
  **physical**, not a Barnes-Hut opening-angle artefact.
- **This is the best-moment figure** — measured at pericenter (widest spread);
  the whole-run average walk factor is ≤ this, so 1.90× is an upper read.

**Caveat (load-bearing, NOT harmless):** single seed, QUICK resolution. At FULL
(smaller ε, deeper resolved wells) peak |a| rises ⇒ the star gravitational spread
*widens* ⇒ subcycling gets MORE attractive, not less. The comparable hydro finding
needed a 4-seed sweep to call itself structural; I0b is one seed / one res. So the
verdict is **"the precondition came in below estimate (2.24× → 1.90×) — the
`hydro+gravity` ROI is marginal at QUICK and reopens the user's scope call,"** NOT
"don't build I-grav." Building `hydro-only` remains unconditionally worth it (I0's
1.68× stands on already-measured gas rungs). A FULL/seed-sweep confirmation of the
star spread is the natural gate before committing I-grav code, if the user wants
to pursue the gravity layer.

### I1 — per-particle CFL is a VECTOR, not the scalar min
`ForceSolver::max_stable_dt` returns `f64` (the min). Individual timesteps need
`h_i / v_sig,i` per gas particle. Add a per-particle variant — either
`max_stable_dt_per_particle(&State) -> Vec<f64>` on the trait (default: a
1-element or gas-length fill of `+∞` for non-hydro solvers) or a `sph`-level
free function the driver calls directly (mirroring how `sph::max_stable_dt` is
called). The scalar `max_stable_dt` stays as-is for the global path — the vector
is additive. Collisionless rows get `+∞` (never rung-limited by hydro).

### I2 — power-of-two rungs below a base dt, synchronized at the base boundary
Assign particle `i` to rung `r_i = clamp(⌈log2(dt_base / (courant·dt_i))⌉, 0,
r_max)`, so its step is `dt_base / 2^r_i`. All rungs synchronize at every
`dt_base` boundary (the standard KDK block-power-of-two scheme): pos AND vel are
consistent there, which is the only place snapshots may be emitted (mirrors the
global path's D3 emit-on-completed-boundary rule). `dt_base` itself is chosen
from the *coarsest* particle's CFL (or a scenario cap), and re-derived each base
block — so this composes with, not replaces, the global bound tracking.

### I3 — a NEW active-set integrator + NEW driver (leave the other two alone)
The existing integrators (`LeapfrogKdk`, `LeapfrogKdkThermal`) kick/drift the
WHOLE state with one `dt` (`core/src/integrator.rs`). Individual timesteps kick
only the *active* subset each fine tick and drift inactive particles by
prediction. That does not fit the `Integrator::step(dt)` interface, so it is a
**distinct type** with an active-mask-aware lifecycle, plus a `run_individual`
driver that owns the rung schedule. Do not branch the existing integrators.

### I4 — momentum is NOT conserved by construction here (a real fork, pick one)
The global-adaptive plan's momentum gate DOES NOT carry over. Global adaptive
kicks *all* particles with one dt, so `Σ mᵢ aᵢ = 0` exactly. Individual
timesteps kick only the active subset — the equal-and-opposite reaction on an
inactive neighbour is omitted this tick and only partially cancels at later,
differently-configured evaluations. So there is a **genuine, bounded momentum
error.** Fork:
- **(a) Gadget-style: kick active only.** Momentum drifts (bounded); cheap; the
  standard choice. **← v1 picks this.**
- **(b) Kick inactive neighbours too.** Momentum-preserving but re-touches
  inactive particles, partially defeating the savings I0 is measuring.

v1 = (a). The momentum gate becomes a **bounded-drift diagnostic** (measure it,
assert it stays under a documented bound over a merger-timescale run), NOT a
roundoff tripwire.

### I5 — the timestep limiter (Saitoh–Makino 2009) is CORRECTNESS, not a dial
The user's "if something's off, lower the timestep of members" maps onto this,
but frame it as **load-bearing**: a slow-rung particle sitting in cold gas that
is suddenly hit by a shock from a fast-rung neighbour will not "notice" until
its next scheduled wake-up — by then the shock has passed through a particle
integrated at the wrong (too-coarse) dt, corrupting exactly the shocked-merger-
gas physics that is this project's whole point (and now *adiabatic*, so the
mis-integrated `u` poisons temperature/pressure downstream). The limiter forces
any particle within `N_limit` rungs of a more-active neighbour to wake and
demote. Its correctness gate — drive a shock into a slow-rung region, assert the
struck particles wake and capture the same energy as a fully-fine reference — is
**central, alongside convergence.** `N_limit` (typically 1) is the only genuine
tuning dial; the mechanism is not optional.

### I6 — neighbour prediction: inactive neighbours must be drifted to current time
SPH force on an active target `i` gathers over neighbours `j`, and the viscosity
/ PdV terms depend on `v_ij` and `r_ij` **at the current sub-time** — but an
inactive `j` was last synchronized at an earlier base-sub-time. So inactive
neighbours must be **predicted** (drift-extrapolated: `x_j ≈ x_j^sync +
v_j·Δt`, and `v_j` predicted for the viscosity term) to the active tick's time
before the gather. This needs per-particle "last-sync pos/vel(/acc)" storage in
the integrator (NOT in `State` — the D2 "h/ρ/derived never stored in State"
discipline; predicted quantities are integrator-owned scratch, like the cached
`acc`). Decide the predictor order (drift-only vs drift+½a·Δt²) in I3; gate it
inside the convergence test.

### I7 — grid-rebuild cadence is the efficiency crux (do not rebuild every fine tick)
The naive loop rebuilds the O(N) `HashGrid` (`cfl.rs:65`, `forces.rs`) every
*fine* tick even when only a handful of particles are active — and if
grid-rebuild + neighbour-prediction cost is comparable to the gathered force
itself, the I0 savings **evaporate**. Decide the rebuild cadence in the plan:
rebuild at the coarsest (base) cadence and query the stale-but-dilated grid on
fine ticks (positions have moved < a fraction of `h`, so a small search-radius
dilation keeps neighbour lists complete — the same "safe over-gather" argument
as the frozen-`h_max` global-support gather), OR rebuild only when the active
fraction exceeds a threshold. This is the D7-analog "correct first, then fuse"
item, but it is more load-bearing here than in the global plan and must be
resolved, not deferred.

### I8 — thermal arm doubles the integrator surface
The active-set integrator must kick `u` (via `du/dt` from `accel_and_dudt`) and
apply the `u`-floor (E4b) **per active subset**, exactly as `LeapfrogKdkThermal`
does for the whole state. Isothermal (`LeapfrogKdk`, no `u`) is the simpler
first arm; the thermal arm lands second (I5-driver already in place). The
`u`-floor leak accounting must still be reported (bounded non-conservation).

### I-grav — gravity subcycling (`hydro+gravity` mode ONLY; the lever-b design surface)
This is the whole cost of chasing ~2.24× over `hydro-only`'s ~1.68×, and it is
**gated OFF unless `[sim.individual].mode = "hydro+gravity"`**. Three coupled
pieces, none needed by `hydro-only`:

1. **A gravitational per-particle dt criterion for STARS.** Collisionless stars
   have hydro `dt = +∞` (coarsest rung) — under `hydro-only` they never subcycle,
   so the gravity walk stays all-N. To reduce the walk to an active subset, stars
   need a *finite* rung from a gravitational criterion `dt_i = η·√(ε/|a_i|)`
   (Plummer softening `ε`, `|a_i|` the gravitational accel). This is the item the
   old Scope parked as "a separate later item" — it is now **in scope, behind the
   toggle**. A floor keeps the coarsest slow stars from an unbounded rung.
2. **Stale-tree gravity gather (the efficiency crux, gravity edition of I7).**
   Rebuild the O(N) tree/grid ONCE per base block; on fine ticks, walk the
   *active subset* against the stale-but-dilated tree. The O(N) build is the
   fixed floor lever (b) cannot cut (and "more stars" inflates it — the log-N
   headwind); the walk is what reduces. Rebuild-every-fine-tick = build × 2^r_max
   = catastrophic, so stale reuse is mandatory. Same "safe over-gather" argument
   as the frozen-`h_max` hydro gather (I7) and the G-series LBVH endpoint.
3. **Gravity prediction of inactive neighbours (gravity edition of I6).** An
   active target's gravity walk gathers contributions from inactive stars/gas
   that were last synced earlier; those must be drift-predicted to the fine tick
   before the walk, exactly as SPH neighbours are (I6). Integrator-owned scratch,
   not `State`.

**Caveat carried on the ~2.24× — NOW MEASURED (I0b, 2026-07-09):** its walk factor
was the unmeasured star gravitational-rung spread. I0b landed it: the drop-finest
star walk factor is **1.42×**, reprojecting `hydro+gravity` to **1.90×** (only +13%
over hydro-only's 1.68×), not 2.24×. The 2.24× was the *ideal ceiling* (full-tail
2.84× ≈ borrowed 2.9×). Verdict MARGINAL at QUICK res / one seed; FULL plausibly
widens the spread (deeper wells). See the **I0b RESULT** block above — the payoff
reopens the user's scope call rather than clearing a bar.

### I-GPU — GPU individual timesteps DEFERRED (rationale recorded)
`GpuResidentLeapfrog::step_many` batches ≤`MAX_BATCH` steps into one submit at a
single `dt` uniform — that batching IS the residency throughput win. Per-particle
rungs mean per-particle active flags, predict kernels, and scatter-add on a
varying active set — research-grade on GPU and it *removes* the single-dt batch
win. v1 is CPU-only; the CPU path is the oracle a future GPU port would gate
against, exactly as the LBVH/G-series lineage did.

## Milestones (TDD: red test committed separately, then green)

- **I0 — measurement / go-no-go (xtask, NOT a red/green milestone). DONE (tool);
  INCONCLUSIVE at QUICK — see "I0 RESULT" above.** `galaxy-xtask rung-spread <dir>`
  histograms per-particle `h_i/v_sig,i` at pericenter + diffuse, min removed, with a
  bit-exact self-check vs `max_stable_dt`. QUICK = 3.90× but tail-fragile; the
  2026-07-09 seed sweep (4 fresh seeds) confirms the ~40% finest-rung haircut is
  **structural** (drop-finest median ~2.9×, below 3×) not seed-noise. The 2026-07-09
  **Amdahl split** (revised) reframed the binding question as *which path rungs
  accelerate*: TWO reducibility levers — (a) per-active-particle dt recompute (the CFL
  solve, free with hydro-only rungs since a rung IS the per-particle dt) and (b) the
  gravity walk on a stale tree (needs scope expansion; build:walk=0.68). Whole-sim win:
  **hydro-only rungs ~1.68× drop-finest / ~2.0× median — clears the 30% bar on lever
  (a) alone**; +gravity subcycling ~2.24×/~3.06×. **The gate is no longer "≥3× at
  FULL"; it is a SCOPE call — how FAR to push (hydro-only vs +gravity), not whether it
  pays. Hydro-only already clears the bar.** FULL regen is low value for this decision
  (same-N, resolves neither the log-N scaling trend nor the scope call). See "AMDAHL
  SPLIT".
- **I0b — gravitational rung-spread (xtask; PRECONDITION for `hydro+gravity` ONLY,
  NOT for `hydro-only`). DONE 2026-07-09 — MARGINAL, see "I0b RESULT" above.**
  `galaxy-xtask grav-rung-spread <dir>` histograms the star gravitational criterion
  `dt_i = η·√(ε/|a_i|)` at pericenter + diffuse, drop-finest factor, θ cross-check vs
  direct sum, Amdahl reprojection. RESULT: star drop-finest walk factor **1.42×**
  (full-tail 2.84×) ⇒ `hydro+gravity` reprojects to **1.90×**, only +13% over
  hydro-only's 1.68× (NOT the 2.24× ceiling). θ=0 rerun identical ⇒ bunching is
  physical. Single seed / QUICK res — FULL plausibly widens the spread. The gravity
  layer's payoff is MARGINAL here; the scope call reopens rather than clears.
  (I0b, I-grav)
- **I1 — per-particle CFL vector. DONE 2026-07-09 (RED 5a90e40 / GREEN 3aa9cd3).**
  `sph::max_stable_dt_per_particle` + `ForceSolver::max_stable_dt_per_particle`
  (trait default `vec![+∞; len]`, `GravitySph` overrides at `c_cfl=1`). Vector is
  state-indexed (gas rows finite at their global index, collisionless `+∞`), a
  textually-verbatim parallel copy of the scalar's inner loop with the min-fold
  replaced by a store — the shipped scalar stays FROZEN. Gates: `min ≡ scalar`
  bit-for-bit (BOTH EOS arms), collisionless `+∞`, static-cloud FULL-vector
  closed-form pin, non-minimal `−3w` approacher pin (advisor teeth — `min ≡ scalar`
  only guards the minimal particle), GravitySph trait plumbing. (I1)
- **I2 — rung assignment (pure fn). DONE 2026-07-09 (RED 4826842 / GREEN 65db7ce).**
  `sim::individual::{assign_rungs, base_dt, rung_step}` (new module beside
  run/run_adaptive). `assign_rungs` bins via an EXACT integer search (smallest `r`
  with `dt_base/2^r ≤ courant·dt_i`) — exact at power-of-two boundaries where a
  float `log2().ceil()` could round either way. `base_dt = courant·max_finite(dt_i)`
  capped; collisionless `+∞` ⇒ rung 0. Gates: uniform⇒one-rung, monotone in 1/dt,
  clamp `[0,r_max]`, hand-derived ceil-log2 (incl. boundaries + courant shift),
  every-finite-rung fits-and-is-tight, base_dt courant-scaled-coarsest-capped. (I2)
- **I3 — active-set KDK stepper + predictor (ISOTHERMAL first). DONE 2026-07-09
  (RED cedb36d / GREEN e203b6f).** `sim::individual::{ActiveSetKdk, predict_pos}`.
  `step_block` sub-cycles a power-of-two rung hierarchy over one base block:
  opening half-kick all → per fine tick {drift ALL by `dt_base/2^r_max`,
  recompute forces, kick the active subset}; rung `r` active every `2^(r_max−r)`
  ticks; interior boundaries merge closing+opening half-kicks into one full-step
  kick, block end takes the closing half. All integer rung arithmetic (no float
  `log2`). **Gate design REVISED vs the pre-build sketch (advisor, 2026-07-09):
  the "single-rung reduces to global-adaptive TO TOLERANCE" framing was weaker
  and wronger.** Replaced by: **collapsed (all rung 0) → BIT-IDENTICAL** to
  `LeapfrogKdk` at `dt_base` (integrator-vs-integrator over 4 blocks incl.
  cached-acc reuse — NOT vs `run_adaptive`, whose growth limiter diverges the dt
  sequence); **multi-rung is a genuinely different correct integrator** (converges
  to the TRUE solution as rungs refine, never bit-compared), gated by (a)
  exactness under constant acceleration (leapfrog exact at any step ⇒ pins the
  open/interior-full/close kick bookkeeping to roundoff) + (b) convergence to the
  analytic oscillator (finer rung tracks closer; coarse-rung error falls ~2nd
  order under base-dt refinement). Predictor is drift-only `x + v·dt`, EXACT for
  KDK (velocity constant between kicks — not an approximation), hand-value pinned.
  Momentum bounded-drift deferred to the I4 driver. Force-caching-AGNOSTIC (takes
  forces through the `ForceSolver` seam ⇒ fresh-vs-stale-tree is I4/I6's policy,
  which is what keeps `hydro-only`/`hydro+gravity` honestly droppable — no I3 test
  pins "fresh gravity every substep"). Drifts every particle at the fine cadence
  (positions exact); `predict_pos` is pinned + ready for I6's predict-inactive
  efficiency switch. Isothermal (`accelerations`); thermal `u`-kick arm is I5/I8.
  (I3, I6, I7)
- **I4 — `sim::run_individual` driver + timestep limiter.** SPLIT into I4a
  (driver) + I4b (limiter) per the user's scope call (2026-07-09) — the driver
  and the correctness-critical limiter each get a focused red/green cycle.
  - **I4a — driver + convergence + momentum diagnostic (ISOTHERMAL). DONE
    2026-07-09 (RED 55b89c0 / GREEN 4da1975).** `sim::{run_individual,
    IndividualConfig, IndividualSummary}` — the block-over-block loop: re-derive
    `dt_base` (`base_dt`, cap `.min(remaining)` to land on the output time) +
    per-particle rungs (`assign_rungs`) from `max_stable_dt_per_particle` each
    base block, sub-cycle via an internally-owned `ActiveSetKdk`, emit on a TIME
    cadence (output index `k` ↔ time `k·output_dt`). Cached-acc carries across the
    varying `dt_base` (velocity-Verlet, no reprime — like `run_adaptive`).
    **Advisor's load-bearing catch: both gates go vacuous on a uniform (one-rung)
    testbed** (active-subset ≡ full kick ⇒ fixed-dt in disguise, already
    bit-pinned in I3), so both run on a **centrally-concentrated core+halo IC**
    (500 gas in r=0.1 + 100 in r=1.0 ⇒ steep h ⇒ steep dt ⇒ real rung spread) and
    SELF-CHECK, on the driver's ACTUAL `IndividualSummary`, that the run spanned
    **≥3 distinct rungs** with the **finest rung `< r_max`** (reference not
    under-resolved). Cap kept **non-binding** (`+∞`) + `output_dt` ≥ a full base
    block ⇒ rung structure is **courant-invariant**, so the three convergence runs
    are comparable and self-reference at fine courant (0.02) is valid. Gates: (i)
    PRIMARY convergence `err(0.1) < err(0.2)` + generous cap (monotone, not an
    order factor); (ii) DIAGNOSTIC momentum drift `drift(0.05) < drift(0.2)` +
    `< 5%` of gross flux (kick-active-only ⇒ ∝ courant, shrinks as courant→0, NOT
    a roundoff tripwire); (iii) cadence on the output grid; gas-free + degenerate
    config reject. NO energy gate. (I4)
  - **I4b — Saitoh–Makino timestep limiter + shock-wakeup gate. DONE 2026-07-10
    (RED 9d52d6d / GREEN 4369268).** After CFL rung assignment, no gas particle
    may sit more than `n_limit` rungs coarser than a force-coupled neighbour — the
    coarser one is refined (woken); `IndividualConfig.n_limit` (typical 1) is the only
    dial. Pieces: `ForceSolver::coupled_pairs` (trait default empty; `GravitySph` →
    `sph::cfl::coupled_pairs`, the THIRD verbatim copy of the `r < SUPPORT·max(h_i,h_j)`
    coupling gate — grid gather at global support, per-pair gated, so the limiter's
    neighbour set never diverges from the force's), `individual::limit_rungs`
    (raise-only fixpoint ⇒ converges; one pass propagates a single hop, the fixpoint
    grades a whole chain), and `run_individual` wiring **SKIPPED when `n_limit >= r_max`**
    (constraint unreachable ⇒ I4a / fixed-dt-disguise byte-identical AND coupled-pairs
    gather kept off the hot path). **BLOCK-BOUNDARY limiting, NOT mid-substep wakeup**
    — advisor-vetted + empirically confirmed via a throwaway probe
    (`xtask/examples/i4b_probe.rs`, deleted): neighbour range (≈2h) ≫ per-block signal
    travel (≈courant·h), so the limiter wakes a victim many base blocks before the
    shock reaches it. Holds in the band Mach ∈ [2/courant, ~10/courant]; below it plain
    CFL refines in time (gate vacuous), above it block-boundary grading can't keep up
    (mid-tick wakeup would be needed — the code LOCATION is coupled to the answer:
    driver-level for block-boundary, inside `ActiveSetKdk` for fine-tick). **The
    load-bearing risk was TEETH: the CFL `v_sig` already carries `−3w`, so own-CFL
    refines a DIRECT approacher on its own — the limiter's distinct value is the extra
    lead from MULTI-HOP graded propagation, observable only when
    `ratio = shock_speed·dt_base/h ≈ Mach·courant/2 ≳ 1`.** Gate = a high-Mach
    directional RAM (dense fast stream into cold at-rest gas, Mach 15, ratio 1.9
    asserted) in THREE arms — fine-courant oracle (0.05, limiter irrelevant at ratio
    ≈0.4, convergence out-of-band |0.05−0.025|≈1.4e-3), limiter-OFF (`n_limit=r_max`),
    limiter-ON (`n_limit=1`) — asserting BOTH that OFF measurably MISSES the oracle
    (non-vacuous: KE-err 5.4%, RMS 5.2e-3) AND that ON RECOVERS it (KE-err 0.48%, ≥3×
    closer; RMS 2.0e-3, ≥1.5× closer), keyed on struck-region kinetic energy (the plan's
    wording) with an RMS-position corroborator. Plus 6 `limit_rungs` pure-fn unit tests
    (one-hop refine, multi-hop chain fixpoint, raise-only monotonicity, symmetry,
    n_limit=0 component collapse, non-binding no-op). Cheap always-on (~0.9s).
    ISOTHERMAL; the thermal `u`-kick arm is I5. (I5)
- **I5 — thermal arm. DONE 2026-07-10 (RED 58c4cb6 \ GREEN 8f21176).**
  `ActiveSetKdkThermal` — a DISTINCT type beside `ActiveSetKdk` (advisor-vetted:
  a separate type keeps the frozen isothermal I3/I4a/I4b bit-paths from ever
  depending on the `accel_and_dudt`-fills-`acc`-like-`accelerations` invariant),
  kicks `u` via `du/dt` wherever it kicks `vel` and floors the just-kicked ACTIVE
  subset (E4b), mirroring `LeapfrogKdkThermal`. Six stepper-level gates (the plan's
  original "reduces to global-adaptive thermal to tolerance" wording is SUPERSEDED
  by bit-identity, exactly as the I3 revision superseded it for the isothermal arm —
  `run_adaptive`'s growth limiter diverges the dt sequence):
    1. COLLAPSED bit-identity (all-rung-0 ≡ `LeapfrogKdkThermal` at `dt_base` on
       pos/vel/`u`/time, real adiabatic hydro solver, `u_min=0` so ordering — not
       the clamp — is what is tested);
    2. INTERIOR full-kick exactness (const accel + const `du/dt`, rungs `[0,2]` ⇒
       closed-form pos/vel/`u` to 1e-12 — the ONLY gate hitting the `n_fine>1`
       interior branch without the floor clamping the value away; advisor-flagged
       gap, teeth-verified: a wrong interior multiplier fails it);
    3. U-FLOOR LEAK EQUALITY (collapsed `with_u_floor` ≡ `LeapfrogKdkThermal`'s
       leak AND `u` bit-for-bit — apples-to-apples, not a hand tolerance);

    5–6. PER-RUNG `du/dt` CONVERGENCE (state-coupled `dudt=|x|²` on SHM = trapezoidal
       quadrature of 2nd-order `x` ⇒ genuinely O(dt²): finer rung tracks analytic
       `u(t)` closer; coarse-rung `u`-error falls ~2nd order under `dt_base` refine).
  STEPPER-ONLY per the advisor — driver wiring (a `[sim.individual]` EOS-arm field
  on `IndividualConfig`, NOT a second `run_individual_thermal`) is owed at I6. (I8)
- **I8 driver + scenario wiring — DONE 2026-07-10 (RED b70555d/GREEN 1a009b5 sim;
  RED adf04b3/GREEN e7d2360 xtask).** The owed pre-I6 wiring, two orthogonal axes:
    * **EOS arm (sim):** `ThermalArm { Isothermal | Adiabatic { u_min } }` field on
      `IndividualConfig` + `u_floor_energy` on `IndividualSummary`. ONE `run_individual`
      dispatches over a private `individual::BlockStepper` trait (impl'd by both
      `ActiveSetKdk` and `ActiveSetKdkThermal`) — `Box<dyn>`, one virtual call per base
      block. Isothermal arm byte-identical (I3/I4a/I4b frozen). Dispatch gate
      (`individual_driver_eos.rs`) drives the SAME real adiabatic solver + IC through
      both arms — the advisor-flagged trap: an isothermal solver fills `du/dt≡0`, so the
      test would be vacuous without a real `Eos::Adiabatic` solver; Adiabatic MUST evolve
      `u` + report the floor leak, Isothermal MUST leave `u` byte-identical.
    * **`mode` toggle (xtask):** `[sim.individual].mode = fixed-dt | hydro-only |
      hydro+gravity` (serde-renamed) on `SimSpec`/`Scenario` (mirrors `[sim.adaptive]`;
      defaults courant 0.25 / r_max 10 / **n_limit 1 binding** / dt_base_cap inf, mode
      hydro-only). `simulate_snapshots` routes gas-rich `hydro-only` → `run_individual`
      (CPU-only, no `CflGuard`); `build_individual_config` derives the output grid + pins
      `eos = Isothermal` (scenarios express only isothermal gas — adiabatic scenario
      wiring stays deferred). REJECTS: adaptive+individual together, `hydro+gravity`

  WHOLE gas set every fine tick ⇒ same force-eval count as global adaptive ⇒ ZERO
  speedup (I6 would have measured ~1×). I7 reduces the *gather* to the ACTIVE
  subset each fine tick. **Design (advisor-vetted 2026-07-10):** gravity stays
  all-N/fresh/unreduced (the `hydro-only` non-rung fraction, f_accel 0.62); the
  grid is rebuilt FRESH every fine tick (build is ~367× cheaper than the gather —
  measured by a throwaway probe on the QUICK pericenter, so the plan's "stale +
  dilated grid" option is REJECTED: at dt_base≈0.5 with dense-knot h≈0.02–0.04 a
  fast particle drifts ~15 h/block, no fixed dilation finds its neighbours);
  positions stay exact (drift-all kept from I3, so no position/velocity
  prediction is needed — `predict_pos` stays pinned-but-unused for I-grav); only
  the density root-find + force gather reduce to the active subset, reading
  persistent ρ/h scratch (active targets refreshed, inactive neighbours read
  stale — the SOLE bounded approximation; all rungs sync at block end ⇒ scratch
  fully refreshed once per base block). **Extraction, not verbatim-copy
  (advisor):** `DensitySetup{solve_one}` and `HydroCtx{force_one}` are single-
  source per-target cores — the full pass maps them over `0..n`, the active pass
  over the subset. Byte-identity is by CONSTRUCTION: grid + seeds computed over
  ALL gas, the solve/force read only positions + per-target hint (independent of
  which targets are active), so `active = 0..n` reproduces the full pass exactly.
  Proven neutral by the frozen `isothermal_regression_pins_pre_e1b_bits` + all
  density/forces gates staying green post-extract. **Interface:**
  `ForceSolver::{accelerations_active, accel_and_dudt_active}` (trait defaults
  forward to the full pass ⇒ non-SPH solvers correct-but-unaccelerated for free);
  `GravitySph` overrides them (gravity all-N + two-pass active hydro on an
  `h_hint`/`rho_scratch` persistent scratch). Both steppers' fine-tick loops call
  `…_active(active_this_tick)`. **Load-bearing warm-start fix:** on the ρ-scratch
  init tick the active path KEEPS an already-sized `h_hint` (from the full
  `accelerations` prime) rather than zeroing it — else the density bisection
  cold-starts to a within-tolerance-but-different `h` and breaks the I3 collapsed
  bit-identity gate. Gates: solver anchors (active-over-ALL ≡ full BIT-IDENTICAL
  for density + fused force; GravitySph checked TWICE so the scratch evolution
  matches too), partial (subset gather on a fresh scratch ≡ full at the active
  indices), stepper force-eval REDUCTION (`Σ_i 2^r_i` per block, not `N·2^r_max`),
  and — the partial-active/stale-neighbour CORRECTNESS — the I4a driver
  convergence + I4b limiter + I5 thermal + I8 dispatch gates ALL now run through
  the wired active path and stay green. (I6, I7)
- **I6 — full-res producibility + speedup validation, `hydro-only` mode. DONE
  2026-07-10 (harness f9c351b, `#[ignore]` full-res run).** Full-res `gasrich`
  (24000 particles / 7000 gas, T=30, 61 snapshots) through `run_individual`
  `hydro-only` at r_max=14: **COMPLETED in 1675.9 s (~27.9 min); wall-clock
  speedup vs the A5 adaptive baseline (2868 s) = 1.71×** (ABOVE the ~1.68×
  projection — the FULL win survived); **CONVERGED** (short-prefix err(0.25)=3.26e-3
  → err(0.125)=1.06e-3, ~3× reduction under courant halving); CFL bound dynamic
  range 30.8× (min 3.80e-3, max 1.17e-1, consistent with A5's temporal 34.2×).
  So all three I6 criteria met — completes AND converges AND the 1.71× measured
  speedup justifies the path. **The toggle ships at `hydro-only`; the 30% bar is
  cleared with room to spare.** (A QUICK pericenter A/B first showed 1.27×; the
  FULL number is higher because the denser knots widen the *gas* rung spread.)
  Snapshots RETAINED at `M:\claud_projects\temp\i6_individual`. NOTE: the 1.71× is
  vs the *documented* A5 baseline (2868 s), not a same-session paired adaptive run
  — a same-session A/B would tighten it, but the margin over 1.3× is comfortable.
  - **I6→I-grav FULL star-spread gate — DONE 2026-07-10, and it says STOP.**
    Ran `grav-rung-spread` on the retained FULL I6 snapshots. At the star
    gravitational pericenter (t=30, θ cross-check 8.7e-2 = within BH tolerance,
    rungs robust NOT an opening-angle artefact): **star walk factor drop-finest
    1.18×** — *narrower* than I0b's QUICK 1.42×, the OPPOSITE of the "FULL widens"
    prediction. With 17000 stars now dominating N, **64% bunch on the single
    finest rung** at the merger core, so dropping it leaves almost no spread.
    Amdahl reprojection with the MEASURED 1.18×: **`hydro+gravity` → 1.79×, only
    +6% over hydro-only's 1.68×**. **VERDICT: ship `hydro-only` and STOP — the
    I-grav design surface (stale-tree gravity walk + gravity prediction +
    gravitational-dt floor) is not worth ~1.79× vs the already-shipped 1.71×.**
    The record gate was meant to "land the real number before spending the I-grav
    budget"; the number says don't spend it. This REOPENS the 2026-07-09
    "build the gravity layer" scope call (which assumed FULL would widen) — a
    user decision, now informed by the real number.
- **I-grav — gravity subcycling (`hydro+gravity` mode). BUILT 2026-07-10** (the
  user chose to build it despite the FULL record gate's +6% / STOP verdict — for
  scaling/completeness). Four milestones, each red→green:
  - **M9 — gravitational rung criterion (pure fn). DONE (RED 5f9a001 / GREEN
    ece636f).** `sim::individual::{grav_rung_dt = η·√(ε/|a|) (+∞ force-free),
    combined_particle_dt = min(hydro CFL, grav)}` — the min-merge that gives
    collisionless stars a finite rung. Gates: hand-derived η·√(ε/|a|), +∞ force-free
    (inverted vs hydro +∞), min-merge semantics, monotonicity in |a|.
  - **M10+M11 — stale-tree active gravity walk (MERGED per advisor). DONE (RED
    <this batch> / GREEN).** Advisor's load-bearing catch: `FlatTree::accel`'s LEAF
    branch reads the PASSED `pos`/`mass`, so passing CURRENT `state.pos` makes every
    near-field source exact FOR FREE (drift-all IS the "predict inactive neighbours"
    of the old piece-3) — only the far-field cell COMs are stale. So "predict" and
    "walk" collapse into one. New: `ForceSolver::{rebuild_gravity_cache (default
    no-op), gravity_active_cached (default → full)}` + a `TreeGravity` wrapper (holds
    the `FlatTree` cache; `BarnesHut` is `Copy` and can't). Gates: fresh-cache
    all-active ≡ `BarnesHut::accelerations` to REASSOCIATION precision (rel<1e-11 —
    the flat left-fold ≠ recursive tree-of-sums bit-for-bit; the doc's "bit-for-bit"
    is the GPU f32 mirror), subset ≡ full at active indices, and the CONVERGENCE gate
    (cache at p0, walk at p1=p0+v·δ vs a fresh FLAT rebuild — err 0 at δ=0, shrinks
    with δ ⇒ far-COM staleness converges; this is why stale-tree works for long-range
    gravity where a stale grid failed for short-range hydro).
  - **M12 — wire `hydro+gravity` + driver subcycling. DONE (GREEN <this batch>).**
    Advisor simplifications: (fork a) NO new `gravity_accel_mag` method — the driver
    gets |a_grav| from `gravity_active_cached(all)` on the fresh cache (gravity-only,
    same tree/θ/ε as the fine-tick walk ⇒ rung–force consistency by construction);
    the DRIVER owns the per-block rebuild (needs it for rungs, cache persists for
    `step_block`), collapsing the block-boundary hook into existing per-block setup.
    `GravitySph.subcycle_gravity` flips the active gravity from all-N to the cached
    active walk; `IndividualConfig.{subcycle_gravity, grav_eta}` (η scales the grav
    TIMESCALE, courant applies uniformly ⇒ courant-invariant rungs). xtask routes
    `mode="hydro+gravity"` → `GravitySph<TreeGravity>` subcycling (η=1.0). **The gate
    that CANNOT exist (advisor): no collapsed-rung-0 ≡ LeapfrogKdk bit-identity — even
    all-rung-0 walks a block-start tree stale by a full step.** Run-level correctness
    = CONVERGENCE only (err shrinks as courant halves); plus SUBCYCLE-ENGAGED (stars
    reach strictly finer rungs than hydro-only — non-vacuous) and MOMENTUM drift
    shrinks with courant (fork b: kick-active-only + stale-tree antisymmetry break,
    both ∝ courant). The `hydro+gravity`→`hydro-only` fallback is NOT a byte-superset
    (fresh all-N ≠ stale-tree gravity even gas-only) — "graceful" = hydro-only's gates
    stay green, untouched.
  - **M-validate — `hydro+gravity` vs `hydro-only` speedup. QUICK DONE 2026-07-10;
    FULL DONE 2026-07-11 — and FULL says hydro+gravity FLOODS (over-collapses).**
    QUICK gasrich pericenter (7500 particles / 2500 gas,
    T=2, throwaway `xtask/examples/igrav_timing.rs`, deleted): **hydro+gravity 9.43 s
    vs hydro-only 24.06 s = 2.55× FASTER** (distinct_rungs 4→9, max_rung 8 both). This
    BLOWS PAST the +6% record-gate reprojection and the advisor's "may be slower"
    caution — but the MECHANISM is not the lever-(b) walk-reduction the record gate
    measured. **`hydro-only` rebuilds the whole Barnes-Hut tree EVERY fine tick**
    (`GravitySph::accelerations_active` → `g.accelerations` → fresh `Octree::build`,
    ×2^r_max = ×256/block here), whereas `hydro+gravity` builds it ONCE per base block
    (the driver's `rebuild_gravity_cache`) and walks the cached `FlatTree`. So most of
    the 2.55× is **eliminating redundant per-tick tree BUILDS**, not the walk factor;
    the pure lever-(b) walk-reduction is still the record gate's ~+6%. **Honest
    attribution + a spinoff that BACKFIRED: `hydro-only` could cache the tree the same
    way (build once/block, walk all-N each tick) using the now-existing `TreeGravity`
    infra, WITHOUT star subcycling.** That spinoff was tried (M-cache) and REVERTED —
    the stale tree floods the merger core at FULL (below).
    **FULL result (2026-07-11) — the QUICK 2.55× does NOT survive; `hydro+gravity`
    over-collapses.** Ran the shipping `hydro+gravity` config at FULL / r_max=14 / full
    horizon (new sibling test `full_res_gasrich_hydrogravity_completes_and_converges`,
    xtask/tests/individual_producibility.rs = the deferred FULL M-validate), read
    incrementally via the per-snapshot gas CFL bound. `hydro+gravity` walks the SAME
    once-per-block STALE tree that made cached-hydro-only flood, and at FULL it floods
    the same way: min-dt drops **below** the fresh floor (3.80e-3) at snap 32, reaches
    **1.13e-3 (0.30× fresh) by snap 39, CFL range 103.9× and climbing** (pericenter runs
    to ~snap 56 ⇒ deeper) — the cached-hydro-only signature (30.8×→196.1×) reproduced.
    Run early-killed at snap 40/61 (verdict unambiguous). **The QUICK 2.55× was a
    QUICK-only artifact** — QUICK never reaches the supersonic (Mach ~10) pericenter
    infall that triggers the flood. At FULL, `hydro+gravity` has NO perf benefit (floods
    → slow). **What this rules OUT: a cached-hydro-only WIRING artifact** — hydro+gravity
    reaches the stale tree through a DIFFERENT code path (`subcycle_gravity`+`TreeGravity`,
    not `cache_gravity_tree`), so the flood is a real property of walking a stale tree, not
    a one-config bug. **It does NOT sharpen the root cause** (an earlier "n=2 ⇒ staleness
    causal" note here was overstated, corrected): the two stale configs SHARE the gas-
    gravity computation (same stale far-COMs, same one-block horizon; stars-kicked-
    differently is 2nd-order on the gas field driving the flood), so this is the SAME
    perturbation reproduced (n=1 with a minor variation), not two independent draws. It
    cannot distinguish staleness-specific causation from chaos-generic-to-merger-pericenters
    (any perturbation of this magnitude diverges into the flood). **ROOT-CAUSE
    INVESTIGATION 2026-07-13 (two throwaway probes, since deleted): instantaneous
    force-injection controls are STRUCTURALLY confounded ⇒ root cause STILL UNRESOLVED.**
    Probe 1 (`flood_dalpha_probe`, post-hoc on the fresh snapshots) measured the staleness
    error δa=a_stale−a_fresh: it is a ~30% coherent OUTWARD (under-attracting, coh_core
    −0.27…−0.65) and neighbour-COHERENT (ρ≈0.70) force error ⇒ its direct v_sig kick is
    ~20–30× too small ⇒ the flood is secular/cross-block, not a one-shot kick — AND the
    naive sign argument (under-attract → higher dt) predicts NO flood, yet it floods (the
    one robust, still-UNEXPLAINED finding). Probe 2 (`flood_signflip`, one full-res re-sim
    injecting 2·a_fresh−a_stale = the sign-flipped δa, preserving ‖δa‖ + neighbour-relative
    content bit-for-bit) is a CONFOUNDED NULL, not a lean: it floods (153.7× range) but its
    deepest point (7.62e-4) is EARLY (t=7) where FRESH sails through (1.17e-2) — sustained
    over-attraction manufactured its own early collapse, a different epoch/channel, not a
    sign-mirror of the pericenter flood; and over-attraction flooding is the mundane
    direction (consistent with both hypotheses). So an instantaneous control CANNOT isolate
    staleness here. The confound-free discriminator (fresh-path IC-jitter ensemble) is
    unrun and imperfect anyway (one-time IC kick ≠ sustained per-tick force error). Root
    cause remains unresolved. **DECISION
    (user call surfaced): ship `hydro-only` fresh
    (1.71×) as default — now for a SECOND, stronger reason than the record gate's +6%:
    hydro+gravity is actively WORSE at FULL, not marginally better. Keep hydro+gravity as
    a droppable toggle for scaling/completeness; do NOT default to it.** Convergence/
    correctness already gated (M12); the FULL test asserts completion + prefix
    convergence, and REPORTS the CFL range as the over-collapse diagnostic. Writeup:
    `M:\claud_projects\temp\mcache_mechanism.md`. (I0b, I-grav)
  - **M-cache — `hydro-only` gravity-tree caching (the M-validate spinoff). DONE
    2026-07-10.** Wired the once-per-base-block tree rebuild into the SHIPPING
    `hydro-only` path: `mode="hydro-only"` now wraps Barnes-Hut in `TreeGravity` and
    walks the cached stale tree (`gravity_active_cached`) each fine tick instead of
    rebuilding a fresh octree ×2^r_max/block. Stars stay on rung 0 — caching is a WALK
    optimization DECOUPLED from rung-folding via the new `IndividualConfig.cache_gravity_tree`
    (the driver rebuilds the cache iff `cache_gravity_tree`, folds gravity into rungs iff
    `subcycle_gravity`, and REJECTS `subcycle_gravity` without the cache). Prep: renamed
    the mis-named `GravitySph.subcycle_gravity` field → `cached_gravity_walk` (it only ever
    gated the walk). **The gate that CAN exist here but not for `hydro+gravity`** (advisor):
    fresh(c) and cached(c) at the SAME courant share rung structure/`dt_base`/integrator,
    so `D(c)=‖cached−fresh‖` isolates tree freshness ALONE — a strictly stronger gate.
    NON-VACUOUS floor `D(coarse)≫roundoff` catches the accidental-every-tick-rebuild bug
    (measured D(0.4)=7.6e-2, ~5 orders above the 1e-6 floor); CONVERGES `D(fine)<D(coarse)`
    (7.6e-2→2.0e-2, ~3.8× per 4× courant — the stale-COM error is O(courant)). Plus a
    FALLBACK bit-identity gate: the cache FLAG on a non-caching `BarnesHut` is byte-identical
    to fresh (machinery adds zero error; all divergence is `TreeGravity`'s stale COMs).
    Fresh path stays reachable in tests only (no scenario knob). The small-scale timing
    A/B (`timing_fresh_vs_cached`, r_max CAPPED at 7) showed a modest 1.42× — but that
    cap was the trap: it structurally prevents the finest-rung flooding that the SHIPPING
    r_max=14 permits, so 1.42× was NOT a lower bound (as first claimed) but a
    failure-mode-suppressed number.
  - **M-cache — REVERTED for `hydro-only` 2026-07-10 (full-res re-measure killed it).**
    The M-validate QUICK A/B and the r_max=7 timing gate both said "small win"; the
    FULL-res re-measure said the opposite. Re-running the I6 producibility test with the
    shipped cached-tree `hydro-only`: **9334.5 s = 0.31× vs A5 (2868 s), i.e. 5.57×
    SLOWER than the fresh-tree I6 (1675.9 s)**, CFL dynamic range 30.8×→**196.1×**.
    Mechanism (post-hoc `rung-spread` over the retained cached snapshots +
    advisor-vetted): the stale per-block tree drives the merger core into a **6.4× deeper
    min stable dt** (5.98e-4 vs fresh ~3.8e-3) that is **SUSTAINED** (~20% of the run,
    t≈19–28) and **BULK** (54% of gas on the two finest rungs at pericenter, no
    numerical-h outlier) — v_sig-dominated (Mach ~10 supersonic infall), density
    secondary (~6× denser). That floods the finest rungs ⇒ ~5.6× more per-particle work.
    Root cause is CONSISTENT WITH stale-tree gravity but NOT isolated from chaotic
    divergence (v_sig-dominated infall is generic to merger pericenters; single chaotic
    trajectory; first-principles sign runs the other way) — so no confident causal arrow.
    A controlled `core_and_stars` fresh-vs-cached A/B at r_max=14 (kept ignored test
    `mechanism_fresh_vs_cached_rmax14`) came back NULL (cached 1.06× SHALLOWER, both
    max_rung 9, cached 0.90× wall) — the quiescent synthetic core lacks the merger's
    supersonic infall, so it does NOT exonerate caching; it DOES confirm the slowdown is
    rung-flooding, not per-walk cost (caching is a small WIN when the trajectory doesn't
    flood). **Decision: caching gives `hydro-only` zero speed upside and no accuracy
    benefit ⇒ reverted to the FRESH walk. `hydro+gravity` KEEPS caching (it needs it —
    subcycling walks the cache — and QUICK showed 2.55×; **it ALSO over-collapses at FULL
    — RESOLVED 2026-07-11, see the M-validate FULL result above: same stale-tree flood,
    QUICK win does not survive, ship hydro-only default).** The wiring change: `simulate.rs` builds bare
    `GravitySph<BarnesHut>` for `hydro-only` and sets `cache_gravity_tree` only for
    `hydro+gravity`; the caching machinery (`TreeGravity`, `with_gravity_cache`,
    `cached_gravity_walk`) and its gate tests are KEPT (hydro+gravity uses them). Fresh
    path is byte-identical to pre-M-cache (I3/I4a bit-identity), so shipping `hydro-only`
    is back to the I6 1.71× fresh numerics. Writeup: `M:\claud_projects\temp\mcache_mechanism.md`.

## Gates (summary — the load-bearing part)

| Gate | Path | What it asserts |
|---|---|---|
| **Full-duration convergence to fine-dt reference** | individual, per-path | PRIMARY: coarse run → fine as courant↓ on a CFL-MOVING testbed (same discipline as global adaptive's convergence gate). |
| **Timestep-limiter shock-wakeup** | individual | CENTRAL correctness (I5): shock into a slow-rung region wakes the struck particles and captures the same energy as a fully-fine reference. |
| **Collapsed rungs ≡ LeapfrogKdk** | individual vs integrator | I3 (REVISED, advisor 2026-07-09 — replaces the old "reduces to global-adaptive to tolerance"): all-rung-0 ⇒ BIT-IDENTICAL to `LeapfrogKdk` at `dt_base` (NOT vs `run_adaptive`, whose growth limiter diverges the sequence). Multi-rung is NOT bit-compared — gated by constant-accel exactness + oscillator convergence. |
| Rung synchronization | individual | pos+vel consistent at every `dt_base` boundary; snapshots emit only there (I2). |
| Momentum bounded-drift | individual | DIAGNOSTIC not tripwire (I4): drift stays under a documented bound (kick-active-only forfeits exact conservation). |
| Per-particle CFL vector `min` ≡ scalar | solver | I1: the vector is a strict generalization of the shipped scalar bound. |
| **Stale-tree gravity walk convergence** | `hydro+gravity` only | I-grav: active-subset walk on a once-per-base-block tree → rebuild-every-tick reference to tolerance (the I7 over-gather argument, gravity edition). |
| Gravity neighbour prediction correct across a base block | `hydro+gravity` only | I-grav: drift-predicted inactive stars/gas keep the walk correct at fine ticks (the I6 argument, gravity edition). |
| Mode ladder falls back gracefully | toggle | `hydro+gravity`→`hydro-only`→`fixed-dt`: dropping a rung of the ladder never touches the paths below it (their gates stay green). |
| Fixed-dt reversibility + energy oscillation | fixed-dt | UNCHANGED, untouched. |
| Global-adaptive convergence + D2b | global | UNCHANGED, untouched. |
| Gas-free byte identity | gas-free | UNCHANGED. |
| ~~Energy conservation~~ | ~~individual~~ | NONE — isothermal heat bath + variable per-particle dt (D4/D2 carry over and worsen); convergence subsumes it. |

## Risks & dependencies

- **I0 is DONE and did NOT kill the plan** — it reframed the go/no-go into a
  scope call (AMDAHL SPLIT). `hydro-only` clears the 30% bar at ~1.68×; the
  original "<2× → stop" rule is superseded. The residual kill risk is now
  per-mode, not whole-plan.
- **The ~2.24× (`hydro+gravity`) rests on an UNMEASURED number.** The gravity-walk
  reduction assumes a favourable *star gravitational-rung* spread; I0 measured
  only gas CFL rungs. **I0b must land before I-grav code** — if the star spread
  is narrow (stars bunch fine near the core), lever (b) underdelivers and the
  right call is to ship `hydro-only` and stop. This is the gravity-path kill
  switch, and it is why gravity is a droppable rung of the toggle, not baked in.
- **The efficiency trap (I7) is the second kill switch.** Grid rebuild +
  neighbour prediction per fine tick can eat the savings; the rebuild cadence
  must be resolved, and the I6 measurement must show the *net* win, not the
  ideal-integrator win. The **gravity** stale-tree gather (I-grav) inherits this
  trap in a sharper form: the O(N) tree build is a fixed floor lever (b) cannot
  cut, and "more stars" inflates it (log-N headwind) — the net gravity win must
  be measured, not assumed.
- **The timestep limiter (I5) is not optional** — without it the adiabatic
  shocked-merger physics (this project's aim) is silently wrong, with no red
  gate unless the shock-wakeup test exists. Build the test with the mechanism.
- **Ordering non-determinism.** Active-set gathering must keep the fixed
  ascending-index gather order (the M7a parallel≡serial discipline) within each
  tick so the run is reproducible.
- **GPU deferral** means the showpiece speedup is CPU-only until a GPU port; the
  CPU path is deliberately the oracle for that later port.
